I tried to show the scene of sunrise and sunset with this project.

## About the project:

Well, well, well
The school information project has complete information about a school.
Our school has several students that we are going to calculate the scores of each student.
Let's say how much is the highest and lowest and get the average score of each class.
Our school is small and does not have much information. But I would be happy if you visit it



## about me :

Hello, hello and hello
how are you guys
Rahela Baz and I teamed up to do a cool project.
We entered the front-end world a few months ago and fell in love with the logic and beauty of this world.
We were also active in other fields. But we are sure that for now we would like to continue this field.
The beautiful world of the web.
Be sure to visit our repositories to learn more about us ;)
